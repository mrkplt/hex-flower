- **Type**: React Web Application
- **Language**: JavaScript (React)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/mrkplt/hex-flower
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (https://mrkplt.com/hex-flower)

**Main Dependencies**:
- React v19.0.0
- styled-components v6.1.17
- react-dnd v16.0.1 (for drag and drop functionality)
- react-color v2.19.3 (for color picking)

**Description**:
A React-based application for creating and managing Hex Flowers, inspired by the Hex Flower Power concept. This tool allows users to build hex flowers with a drag-and-drop interface. The application enables users to create custom tiles with text and images, arrange them in a hexagonal grid, and export the final design.
